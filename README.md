In this project, I will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that I learned previously.

I am given 3 designs for a web app, I should code the entire design using what I have lernt.

- Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px
- Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
